	<h1>Welcome</h1>
	<p>
	    Trongate is a powerful and flexible PHP framework designed to streamline the development of web applications. Whether you're building a simple website, a RESTful API, or a complex enterprise application, Trongate provides the tools and structure you need to succeed.
	</p>

	<p>
    While Trongate is known for its impressive speed, its primary focus is on <b>stability</b>.  This puts Trongate in stark contrast to other PHP frameworks - some of which are subjected to ongoing rewrites.  By prioritizing a stable core, Trongate allows PHP developers to build robust, highly performant applications with confidence, knowing that their foundation is rock-solid.
    </p>

    <h2>Top Five Reasons To Use Trongate</h2>
	<h4><b>Reason 1: Stability</b></h4>
	<p>Trongate is the <i>only</i> PHP framework (as far as we know!) that prioritizes stability above all else. The framework is updated and improved <i>constantly</i>. What sets Trongate apart is the belief that it should be not only possible but <i>normal</i> to enhance PHP frameworks without constantly breaking them.</p>

	<h4><b>Reason 2: No Third-Party Libraries</b></h4>
	<p>
	    Frameworks that rely on third-party code are often subject to external security concerns and frequent updates that can disrupt projects. While third-party libraries can be useful, they should not form the core of a PHP framework. Trongate avoids this pitfall by offering its own JavaScript libraries, CSS library, API manager, graphical query builder, code generator, and more - enabling developers to get up and running without relying on external dependencies.
	</p>

	<h4><b>Reason 3: Outrageously Fast Benchmarks</b></h4>
	<p>
	    As far as we know, Trongate is the fastest PHP framework in the world. Its lightweight core and optimized architecture ensure lightning-fast performance, making it ideal for developers who need quick load times and efficient resource usage. By minimizing bloat and avoiding unnecessary dependencies, Trongate delivers exceptional speed, allowing you to build high-performance applications with ease. This incredible speed can significantly enhance user experience, making it a compelling reason to choose Trongate for your next project.
	</p>

	<h4><b>Reason 4: Truly Modular Architecture</b></h4>
	<p>
	    Unlike frameworks relying on Composer-managed 'vendor' directories, Trongate loads modules independently, reducing overhead and significantly boosting performance.
	</p>
	<p>
	    Trongate's <b>truly modular</b> architecture fosters modular encapsulation, where each module operates as a self-contained MVC unit. This approach enhances scalability, simplifies maintenance, and promotes code reusability and flexibility, empowering developers to build, collaborate, and expand applications efficiently.
	</p>

	<h4><b>Reason 5: Easy to Learn</b></h4>
	<p>
	    Trongate prides itself on being incredibly easy to learn. Its syntax closely resembles pure PHP, favoring conventions like snake case that are familiar to PHP developers. This simplicity not only shortens the learning curve for new developers but also enhances productivity and code readability throughout the development lifecycle.
